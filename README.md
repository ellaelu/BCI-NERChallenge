### Introduction:

### Preproccessing Data:

Move all of the downloaded content to the Data subfolder within this repo, extract the train.zip and test.zip to their respective train and test subfolders

Run preprocess.ipynb to create X_train and X_test to be used in models

or

Ingest the data from as they are the post processed data using Riemann spaces (XDawnCovariance and Tangent Space mapping): 
* /Data/X_train_final.npy
* /Data/X_test_final.npy

Train labels can be found in:
* /Data/TrainLabels.csv

True Test labels can be found in:
* /Data/true_labels.csv

See Models.ipynb for application of data.
